To submit a new album:
	1. AJAX handles click of E	(topnav-add-new-button)
	2. jQuery show O, P (main-add-album-container, add-album-intro)
	3. jQuery hides I, J, N
	4. O <div id="add-album-intro" > displays dropdown of existing artists. User selects one or can add new one.
	5. AJAX handles On artist select from dropdown, $("#choose_artist").change(function(){
	6. AJAX hides P (add-album-intro) and replaces the html in <div id="add-album"> with generated code in log_functions.php	
		THE problem with genenrated code is that normally AJAX can only look for items that existed at time of first creation
		BUT it can find later generated stuff via "Event Delegation"
